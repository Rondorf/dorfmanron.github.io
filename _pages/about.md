I'm a third year Ph.D. student in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department](https://ece.technion.ac.il) at the [Technion - Israel Institute of Technology](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/home-2/), advised by Professor [Kfir Y.  Levy](https://kfiryehud.wixsite.com/kfir-y-levy). My research interests lie at the intersection of optimization and machine learning. Concretely, my main focus is on devising efficient, scalable optimization algorithms with theoretical convergence guarantees; I'm also interested in applications to distributed and federated learning. 

Previously, I completed my M.Sc. (summa cum laude) under the advisement of Professor [Aviv Tamar](https://avivt.github.io/avivt/), working on offline meta-reinforcement learning, and my B.Sc (summa cum laude), both at the ECE Department of the Technion.
